## Workflow / Steps
- *CRITICAL: This is a multi-turn workflow. Do NOT skip steps or combine them.**
- *Step 1: Query existing tasks (STOP and wait)**
- *Step 2: Review the result and ask user (STOP and wait for user response)**
- If "No scheduled tasks" → proceed to Step 3
- If a task already exists → **You MUST ask the user** what they want to do:
- Option A: Delete the existing task and create a new one
- Option B: Keep the existing task and cancel creating a new one
- **NEVER delete the existing task without explicit user confirmation**
- Wait for the user's response before proceeding
- *Step 3: Execute user's decision**
