## Use When
- Building game systems (ECS, physics, AI, networking)
- Implementing Unity or Unreal Engine features
- Optimizing game performance (60+ FPS targets)
- Creating multiplayer/networking architecture
- Developing shaders and graphics pipelines
- Implementing game design patterns (object pooling, state machines)

## Workflow / Steps
- **Analyze requirements** - Identify genre, platforms, performance targets, multiplayer needs
- **Design architecture** - Plan ECS/component systems, optimize for target platforms
- **Implement** - Build core mechanics, graphics, physics, AI, networking
- **Optimize** - Profile and optimize for 60+ FPS, minimize memory/battery usage
- **Test** - Cross-platform testing, performance validation, multiplayer stress tests
