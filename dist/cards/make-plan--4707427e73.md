# make-plan

Create a detailed, phased implementation plan with documentation discovery. Use when asked to plan a feature, task, or multi-step implementation — especially before executing with do-plan.

## Quick Facts
- id: `make-plan--4707427e73`
- worth_using_score: `35/100`
- tags: `ci, docs`
- source: `agent_playground`
- source_path: `/home/wolvend/codex/agent_playground/source/agents/tooling/claude-mem/openclaw/skills/make-plan/SKILL.md`

## Workflow / Steps
- Sources consulted (files/URLs) and what was read
- Concrete findings (exact API names/signatures; exact file paths/locations)
- Copy-ready snippet locations (example files/sections to copy)
- "Confidence" note + known gaps (what might still be missing)
- Search for and read relevant documentation, examples, and existing patterns
- Identify the actual APIs, methods, and signatures available (not assumed)
- Create a brief "Allowed APIs" list citing specific documentation sources
- Note any anti-patterns to avoid (methods that DON'T exist, deprecated parameters)
- **What to implement** — Frame tasks to COPY from docs, not transform existing code
- Good: "Copy the V2 session pattern from docs/examples.ts:45-60"
