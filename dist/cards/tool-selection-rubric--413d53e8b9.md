# tool-selection-rubric

A practical rubric for deciding whether a library/repo/tool is worth adopting: maintenance, docs, security, compatibility, and escape hatches.

## Quick Facts
- id: `tool-selection-rubric--413d53e8b9`
- worth_using_score: `65/100`
- tags: `github, git, python, node, go, security, ci, docs`
- source: `agent_playground`

## Use When
- You found a promising GitHub repo/library and need to decide quickly.
- You’re choosing between multiple options (same category).
- You want to avoid supply-chain traps and abandoned projects.

## Workflow / Steps
- Fit: does it solve your exact use case with minimal glue?
- Health: is it maintained and used by real people?
- Safety: what permissions does it need, and can you sandbox it?
- Integration: does it fit your stack (Python/Node/CI/OS)?
- Exit: can you swap it out later without rewriting everything?
