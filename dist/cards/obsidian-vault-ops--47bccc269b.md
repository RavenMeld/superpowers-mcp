- You’re building an “engineering knowledge base” and want structure to stick.

## Workflow / Steps
- Find target notes (search by content or properties/frontmatter).
- Read the note(s) before editing.
- Prefer small, anchored edits (patch) over whole-file rewrites.
- Update frontmatter separately when possible.
