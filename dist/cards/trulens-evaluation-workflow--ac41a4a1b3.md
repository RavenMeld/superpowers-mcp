## Workflow / Steps
- Set up comprehensive evaluation for a new LLM app
- Improve an existing app's evaluation coverage

- *Before implementing, always ask the user these questions:**
- What framework is your app built with? (LangChain, LangGraph/Deep Agents, LlamaIndex, Custom)
- *For Agents, also ask:**
- Does your agent do explicit planning? (determines if Plan Quality/Adherence metrics apply)
