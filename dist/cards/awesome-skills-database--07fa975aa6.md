# awesome-skills-database

Use the local Awesome SKILLS database to quickly find and rank `SKILL.md` files.
Trigger when:
- the user asks "which skill should we use?"
- you need to search for the right `SKILL.md` across multiple roots
- you want a deterministic "worth using" ranking (not just text match)

## Quick Facts
- id: `awesome-skills-database--07fa975aa6`
- worth_using_score: `60/100`
- tags: `mcp, python, ci, llm`
- source: `codex_skills`
- source_path: `/home/wolvend/.codex/skills/awesome-skills-database/SKILL.md`

## Use When
