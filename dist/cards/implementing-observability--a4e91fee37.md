# implementing-observability

Monitoring, logging, and tracing implementation using OpenTelemetry as the unified standard. Use when building production systems requiring visibility into performance, errors, and behavior. Covers OpenTelemetry (metrics, logs, traces), Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger, Tempo, structured logging (structlog, tracing, slog, pino), and alerting.

## Use When
- Building production systems requiring visibility into performance and errors
- Debugging distributed systems with multiple services
- Setting up monitoring, logging, or tracing infrastructure
