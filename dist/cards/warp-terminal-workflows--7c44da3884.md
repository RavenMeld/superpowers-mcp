## Workflow / Steps
- You use Warp as your daily terminal and want faster repeatable command runs.
- You want a clean workflow for SSH sessions, project entrypoints, and env setup.
- You want to share runbooks with teammates without leaking secrets.
- Define your “project entry” commands (cd + env + dev server).
- Save common commands/workflows so they stay discoverable.
- Create SSH session shortcuts (hostnames + identities).
- Keep secrets out of shared workflows; inject via env or a secret manager.
- Never bake tokens/keys into saved workflows if they sync to the cloud.
- Prefer least-privilege SSH identities and host aliases per account.
