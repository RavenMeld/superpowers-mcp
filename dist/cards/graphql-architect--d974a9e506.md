## Use When
- Designing GraphQL schemas and type systems
- Implementing Apollo Federation architectures
- Building resolvers with DataLoader optimization
- Creating real-time GraphQL subscriptions
- Optimizing query complexity and performance
- Setting up authentication and authorization

## Workflow / Steps
- **Domain Modeling** - Map business domains to GraphQL type system
- **Design Schema** - Create types, interfaces, unions with federation directives
- **Implement Resolvers** - Write efficient resolvers with DataLoader patterns
- **Secure** - Add query complexity limits, depth limiting, field-level auth
- **Optimize** - Performance tune with caching, persisted queries, monitoring
