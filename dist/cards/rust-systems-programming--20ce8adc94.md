## Use When
- Building systems software requiring memory safety without garbage collection
- Developing high-performance applications with zero-cost abstractions
- Writing concurrent or parallel programs with data race prevention
- Creating async/await applications for I/O-bound workloads (web servers, databases)
- Working with low-level code, FFI, or hardware interfaces
- Replacing C/C++ code with safer alternatives
- Building command-line tools, network services, or embedded systems
- Optimizing performance-critical sections of applications
- Creating libraries that guarantee memory safety at compile time
- Developing WebAssembly modules for near-native performance
