# scientific-writing

Core skill for the deep research and writing tool. Write scientific manuscripts in full paragraphs (never bullet points). Use two-stage process with (1) section outlines with key points using research-lookup then (2) convert to flowing prose. IMRAD structure, citations (APA/AMA/Vancouver), figures/tables, reporting guidelines (CONSORT/STROBE/PRISMA), for research papers and journal submissions.

## Use When
- Writing or revising any section of a scientific manuscript (abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion)
- Structuring a research paper using IMRAD or other standard formats
- Formatting citations and references in specific styles (APA, AMA, Vancouver, Chicago, IEEE)
- Creating, formatting, or improving figures, tables, and data visualizations
- Applying study-specific reporting guidelines (CONSORT for trials, STROBE for observational studies, PRISMA for reviews)
- Drafting abstracts that meet journal requirements (structured or unstructured)
- Preparing manuscripts for submission to specific journals
- Improving writing clarity, conciseness, and precision
- Ensuring proper use of field-specific terminology and nomenclature
- Addressing reviewer comments and revising manuscripts

## Workflow / Steps
- *CRITICAL: Always write in full paragraphs, never submit bullet points in scientific papers.**
- *Stage 1: Create Section Outlines with Key Points**
- Use the research-lookup skill to gather relevant literature and data
- Create a structured outline with bullet points marking:
- Main arguments or findings to present
- Key studies to cite
- Data points and statistics to include
- Logical flow and organization
- These bullet points serve as scaffolding—they are NOT the final manuscript
- *Example outline (Introduction section):**
