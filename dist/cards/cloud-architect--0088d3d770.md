## Workflow / Steps
- **Discovery** - Assess current state, requirements, constraints, compliance needs
- **Design** - Select services, design topology, plan data architecture
- **Security** - Implement zero-trust, identity federation, encryption
- **Cost Model** - Right-size resources, reserved capacity, auto-scaling
- **Migration** - Apply 6Rs framework, define waves, test failover
- **Operate** - Set up monitoring, automation, continuous optimization
