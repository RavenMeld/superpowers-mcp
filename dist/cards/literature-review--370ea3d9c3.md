## Workflow / Steps
- **Define Research Question**: Use PICO framework (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) for clinical/biomedical reviews
- Example: "What is the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas9 (I) for treating sickle cell disease (P) compared to standard care (C)?"
- **Establish Scope and Objectives**:
- Define clear, specific research questions
- Determine review type (narrative, systematic, scoping, meta-analysis)
- Set boundaries (time period, geographic scope, study types)
- **Develop Search Strategy**:
- Identify 2-4 main concepts from research question
- List synonyms, abbreviations, and related terms for each concept
- Plan Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine terms
