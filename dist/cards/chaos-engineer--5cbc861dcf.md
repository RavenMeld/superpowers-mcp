- source: `agent_playground`
- source_path: `/home/wolvend/codex/agent_playground/source/agents/tooling/claude-skills/skills/chaos-engineer/SKILL.md`

## Use When
- Designing and executing chaos experiments
- Implementing failure injection frameworks (Chaos Monkey, Litmus, etc.)
- Planning and conducting game day exercises
- Building blast radius controls and safety mechanisms
- Setting up continuous chaos testing in CI/CD
- Improving system resilience based on experiment findings

## Workflow / Steps
- **System Analysis** - Map architecture, dependencies, critical paths, and failure modes
- **Experiment Design** - Define hypothesis, steady state, blast radius, and safety controls
- **Execute Chaos** - Run controlled experiments with monitoring and quick rollback
- **Learn & Improve** - Document findings, implement fixes, enhance monitoring
- **Automate** - Integrate chaos testing into CI/CD for continuous resilience
