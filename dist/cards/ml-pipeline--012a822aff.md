## Use When
- Building feature engineering pipelines and feature stores
- Orchestrating training workflows with Kubeflow, Airflow, or custom systems
- Implementing experiment tracking with MLflow, Weights & Biases, or Neptune
- Creating automated hyperparameter tuning pipelines
- Setting up model registries and versioning systems
- Designing data validation and preprocessing workflows
- Implementing model evaluation and validation strategies
- Building reproducible training environments
- Automating model retraining and deployment pipelines

## Workflow / Steps
- **Design pipeline architecture** - Map data flow, identify stages, define interfaces between components
- **Implement feature engineering** - Build transformation pipelines, feature stores, validation checks
- **Orchestrate training** - Configure distributed training, hyperparameter tuning, resource allocation
- **Track experiments** - Log metrics, parameters, artifacts; enable comparison and reproducibility
- **Validate and deploy** - Implement model validation, A/B testing, automated deployment workflows
