## Quick Facts
- id: `pptx--92f687a50b`
- worth_using_score: `55/100`
- tags: `playwright, python, ci`
- source: `agent_playground`
- source_path: `/home/wolvend/codex/agent_playground/source/ui/AionUi/skills/pptx/SKILL.md`

## Workflow / Steps
- **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`html2pptx.md`](html2pptx.md) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with presentation creation.
- Create an HTML file for each slide with proper dimensions (e.g., 720pt × 405pt for 16:9)
- Use `<p>`, `<h1>`-`<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>` for all text content
- Use `class="placeholder"` for areas where charts/tables will be added (render with gray background for visibility)
- **CRITICAL**: Rasterize gradients and icons as PNG images FIRST using Sharp, then reference in HTML
- **LAYOUT**: For slides with charts/tables/images, use either full-slide layout or two-column layout for better readability
- Create and run a JavaScript file using the [`html2pptx.js`](scripts/html2pptx.js) library to convert HTML slides to PowerPoint and save the presentation
- Use the `html2pptx()` function to process each HTML file
- Add charts and tables to placeholder areas using PptxGenJS API
- Save the presentation using `pptx.writeFile()`
