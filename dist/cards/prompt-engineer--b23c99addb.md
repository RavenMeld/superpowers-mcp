## Use When
- User provides a vague or generic prompt (e.g., "help me code Python")
- User has a complex idea but struggles to articulate it clearly
- User's prompt lacks structure, context, or specific requirements
- Task requires step-by-step reasoning (debugging, analysis, design)
- User needs a prompt for a specific AI task but doesn't know prompting frameworks
- User wants to improve an existing prompt's effectiveness
- User asks variations of "how do I ask AI to..." or "create a prompt for..."

## Workflow / Steps

- *Actions:**
- Read the raw prompt provided by the user
- Detect task characteristics:
- **Type:** coding, writing, analysis, design, learning, planning, decision-making, creative, etc.
- **Complexity:** simple (one-step), moderate (multi-step), complex (requires reasoning/design)

- Identify implicit requirements:
- Does user need examples?
