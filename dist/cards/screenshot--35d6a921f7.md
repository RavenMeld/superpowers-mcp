# screenshot

Use when the user explicitly asks for a desktop or system screenshot (full screen, specific app or window, or a pixel region), or when tool-specific capture capabilities are unavailable and an OS-level capture is needed.

## Quick Facts
- id: `screenshot--35d6a921f7`
- worth_using_score: `65/100`
- tags: `mcp, playwright, browser, python, ci, figma, windows, linux`
- source: `codex_skills`

## Workflow / Steps
- "Take a look at <App> and tell me what you see": capture to temp, then view each printed path in order.
- "The design from Figma is not matching what is implemented": use a Figma MCP/skill to capture the design first, then capture the running app with this skill (typically to temp) and compare the raw screenshots before any manipulation.
