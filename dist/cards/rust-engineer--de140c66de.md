# rust-engineer

Use when building Rust applications requiring memory safety, systems programming, or zero-cost abstractions. Invoke for ownership patterns, lifetimes, traits, async/await with tokio.

- tags: `rust, go, testing, ci, rag, benchmark`
- source: `codex_skills`
- source_path: `/home/wolvend/.codex/skills/rust-engineer/SKILL.md`

## Use When
- Building systems-level applications in Rust
- Implementing ownership and borrowing patterns
- Designing trait hierarchies and generic APIs
- Setting up async/await with tokio or async-std
- Optimizing for performance and memory safety
- Creating FFI bindings and unsafe abstractions

## Workflow / Steps
- **Analyze ownership** - Design lifetime relationships and borrowing patterns
- **Design traits** - Create trait hierarchies with generics and associated types
- **Implement safely** - Write idiomatic Rust with minimal unsafe code
- **Handle errors** - Use Result/Option with ? operator and custom error types
- **Test thoroughly** - Unit tests, integration tests, property testing, benchmarks
