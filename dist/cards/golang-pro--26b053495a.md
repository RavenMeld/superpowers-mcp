## Use When
- Building concurrent Go applications with goroutines and channels
- Implementing microservices with gRPC or REST APIs
- Creating CLI tools and system utilities
- Optimizing Go code for performance and memory efficiency
- Designing interfaces and using Go generics
- Setting up testing with table-driven tests and benchmarks

## Workflow / Steps
- **Analyze architecture** - Review module structure, interfaces, concurrency patterns
- **Design interfaces** - Create small, focused interfaces with composition
- **Implement** - Write idiomatic Go with proper error handling and context propagation
- **Optimize** - Profile with pprof, write benchmarks, eliminate allocations
- **Test** - Table-driven tests, race detector, fuzzing, 80%+ coverage
